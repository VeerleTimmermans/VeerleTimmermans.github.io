    <div>
    <p> 
      With a love for puzzels and riddles I am very happy with my current PhD
      position in Operation Research at Maastricht University. I am mainly 
      working on uniqueness and computation of Nash equilibria in atomic 
      splittable congestion games. Here matroids and polymatroids turn out to 
      be particular interesting concepts.
    </p> 

    <p>
      Besides my research I like to teach and tutor. When I'm not at work, I'm 
      probably playing board games or cards with friends, or dancing, training for 
      my next Taekwondo belt, travelling, hiking, baking or watching a movie at the cinema.

    <div class="cv"> <h3> Experience </h3>
	<p> During my bachelors (2008 - 2012) I had several teaching jobs on the side. Among others, I:
	<ul> 
	  <li> Taught math to second and third year High School students from  'Maaswaal College' 
		in Wijchen as a replacement teacher for three months. </li>
	  <li> Gave 3-day courses to prepare students for their final exams. The courses were 
		organized by SSL Leiden. In total I gave around 25 3-day courses. </li>
	  <li> Designed exercises for online study environment 'Got-it' for company 
		'Thieme Meulenhoff'.</li>
	  <li> Tutored bachelor courses 'Graph Theory' and 'Math, politics and Economics' 
		at the Radboud University in Nijmegen.</li>
	</ul>
	During my masters (2012 - 2014) I decided to focus more on my studies, and mainly recorded 
	lectures and worked in the university library.

	and my master's. During my bachelor's I obtained my secnd degree teachling license, had a boardyear 
	as treasurer for study association 'Olympus', and followed for 30ECTS courses from the Computer Science 
	department. For one of the courses, 'Community Outreach Project, I travelled to Kampala, Uganda
	to teach highschool and primary school teachers about computers.  
	</p>
	<p>
	In my master's I followed the Research Track with a focus on Operations Research. My master thesis is

    </div>  
      <h3> In general </h3>
      <p class="link">
      In July 2014 I started as a PhD-student at Maastricht University, under the supervision of 
      <a href="https://www.math.uni-augsburg.de/prof/opt/mitarbeiter/harks/"> Tobias Harks </a>. I am on schedule, and plan to get my diploma in July 2018.
      </p>
      <h3> Research </h3>
      <p>
      My research interests include, but are not limited to: Algorithmic Game Theory, Cooperative Game Theory, Combinatorial Optimization. So far, we studied pure Nash equilibria in atomic splittable congestion games, and are particularly interested in uniqueness of equilibria and equilibrium computation. Finished projects can be found on the right. 
      </p>
      <h3> Teaching </h3>
      <p class="link"> In 2015 I got my BKO, which allows me to teach at universities in the Netherlands. Currently I am involved in the course <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/meta/96965/basic-mathematical-tools">'Basic Mathematical Tools' </a>, given at UCM, and <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/meta/96931/management-operations-and-product-development">'Management of Operations and Product Development' </a> at Maastricht University.</p>
	<h3> Other activities </h3>
      <p> Besides research and teaching, I am learning some programming languages using Code Academy. This personal page is coded completely from scratch using html. Besides the html and css course, I followed the Javascript course, and Python is up next.  </p>

	   Uniqueness of Equilibria in Atomic Splittable Polymatroid Congestion Games (ISCO 2016) </h2> </a> 
      <p> We study uniqueness of Nash equilibria in atomic splittable congestion games and derive a uniqueness result based on polymatroid theory: when the strategy space of every player is a bidirectional flow polymatroid, then equilibria are unique. Bidirectional flow polymatroids are introduced as a subclass of polymatroids possessing certain exchange properties. We show that important cases such as base orderable matroids can be recovered as a special case of bidirectional flow polymatroids. On the other hand we show that matroidal set systems are in some sense necessary to guarantee uniqueness of equilibria: for every atomic splittable congestion game with at least three players and non-matroidal set systems per player, there is an isomorphic game having multiple equilibria. Our results leave  a gap between base orderable matroids and general matroids for which we do not know whether equilibria are unique. </p>

          Equilibrium Computation in Atomic Splittable Singleton Congestion Games (IPCO 2017) </h2> </a>
      <p> We devise the first polynomial time algorithm computing a pure Nash equilibrium for atomic splittable congestion games with singleton strategies and player-specific affine cost functions. Our algorithm is purely combinatorial and computes the exact equilibrium assuming rational input.  The idea is to compute a pure Nash equilibrium for an associated integrally-splittable  singleton congestion game in which the players can only split their demands in integral multiples of a common packet size. While integral games have been considered in the literature before, no polynomial time algorithm computing an equilibrium was known. Also for this class, we devise the first polynomial time algorithm and use it as a building block for our main algorithm.	 </p>

      <h1>  Future  </h1>
    </div>  
      <h3> Until July 2018 </h3>
      <p> The goal is to finish at least one more research project, 
          and write one more paper. I will discuss the topic of my last research project 
          with my supervisor mid February. 
          </p>
      <p> In the mean time, I want to develop several new skills. In the past weeks I've
	  finished courses in html, CSS and JavaScript (and as a result this personal page).
	  Now, I want to continue with the basics of Python, SQL, Java and PHP.  </p>

    <h3> After July 2018 </h3>
      <p> After I get my PhD-diploma I will be looking for a job. For now I am not
          sure what type of career I want to pursuit, but there are several directions 
          in which I am particularly interested:
           <ul>          
		<li> A tenure track on a Dutch University. I love doing research: 
		discussing new ideas with colleagues and solving hard puzzels. Little 
                is as rewarding as to finally solve the problem you have been studying for 
		months.  </li>
		<li> An OR-related position in a company. I think that solving practical 
		problems contributes to society. Also, I would like to do some more programming. 
		I love to learn, and using my mathematical/OR background, I would not 
		only be able to create algorithms, but also program them and use
		them in practise. </li>
		<li> A lecturer position on a Dutch university of applied sciences. 
		I love to create course content and to experiment with new activities
		during the lessons. </li>
           </ul>
