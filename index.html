    <p> 
      With a love for puzzels and riddles I am very happy with my current PhD
      position in Operation Research at Maastricht University. I am mainly 
      working on uniqueness and computation of Nash equilibria in atomic 
      splittable congestion games. Here matroids and polymatroids turn out to 
      be particular interesting concepts.
    </p> 

    <p>
      Besides my research I like to teach, play board games or cards, hike, 
      travel, dance, and maintaining a tiny garden on our balcony.

      <h3> In general </h3>
      <p class="link">
      In July 2014 I started as a PhD-student at Maastricht University, under the supervision of 
<a href="https://www.math.uni-augsburg.de/prof/opt/mitarbeiter/harks/">
 Tobias Harks </a>. I am on schedule, and plan to get my diploma in July 2018.
      </p>
      <h3> Research </h3>
      <p>
      My research interests include, but are not limited to: Algorithmic Game Theory,
Cooperative Game Theory, Combinatorial Optimization. So far, we studied pure Nash equilibria in atomic splittable congestion games, 
and are particularly interested in uniqueness of equilibria and equilibrium
computation. 
      </p>
      <h3> Teaching </h3>
      <p> In 2015 I got my BKO, which allows me to teach at universities
in the Netherlands. Currently I am involved in the course 'Basic Mathematical
Tools', given at UCM, and 'Management of Operations and product
development at Maastricht University.</p>
	<h3> Other activities </h3>
      <p> Besides research and teaching, I am learning some programming languages using Code Academy.
This personal page is coded completely from scratch using html. Besides the html and css course, 
I followed the Javascript course, and Python is up next.  </p>

	   Uniqueness of Equilibria in Atomic Splittable Polymatroid Congestion Games (ISCO 2016) </h2> </a> 
      <p> We study uniqueness of Nash equilibria in atomic splittable congestion
games and derive a uniqueness result based on polymatroid theory: when the strategy space
of every player is a bidirectional flow polymatroid, then equilibria are unique.
Bidirectional flow polymatroids are introduced as a subclass of polymatroids possessing 
certain exchange properties. We show that important cases such as base orderable matroids
can be recovered as a special case of bidirectional flow polymatroids.
On the other hand we show that matroidal set systems are in some sense
necessary to guarantee uniqueness of equilibria: for every atomic splittable congestion
game with at least three players and non-matroidal set systems per player, there is
an isomorphic game having multiple equilibria. Our results leave 
a gap between base orderable matroids and general matroids for which 
we do not know whether equilibria are unique. </p>

          Equilibrium Computation in Atomic Splittable Singleton Congestion Games (IPCO 2017) </h2> </a>
      <p> We devise the first polynomial time algorithm computing a pure Nash equilibrium 
for atomic splittable congestion games with singleton strategies and 
player-specific affine cost functions. Our algorithm is purely 
combinatorial and computes the exact equilibrium assuming rational input.  The idea 
is to compute a pure Nash equilibrium for an associated integrally-
splittable  singleton congestion game in which the players can only 
split their demands in integral multiples of a common packet size. 
While integral games have been considered in the literature before, 
no polynomial time algorithm computing an equilibrium was known. Also 
for this class, we devise the first polynomial time algorithm and use 
it as a building block for our main algorithm.	 </p>
